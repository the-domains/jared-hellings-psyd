Welcome to my website. I am a clinical psychologist working in beautiful downtown Edmonds, WA, where I work with people of all ages to help address a range of problems. Seeking help can be a humbling and anxiety-filled experience. I encourage you to look around my website to get some answers to a few basic questions. Please contact me for additional information. 

I often see individuals in therapy when they are dealing with stress, difficult and overwhelming emotions, and/or problems in relationships. My focus is to create a safe and non-judgmental atmosphere where individuals can explore the thoughts, feelings, and relationship patterns that trouble them. 

In addition to therapy, I specialize in the assessment of attention and learning problems for children, teens, and adults. Typically, I see people who are concerned that they have a specific learning disability, such as dyslexia, or ADHD.
