I am a licensed clinical psychologist in Washington State (\#60068969). After completing a bachelor's degree in Psychology at Central Washington University, I started working with teenagers in group homes and the foster care system. I worked with so many special kids and families; they inspired me to pursue further training so I completed a doctorate in clinical psychology (PsyD) at Argosy University in 2008\. 

As part of my training, I completed a one-year internship at the University of Washington Counseling Center and then a two year postdoctoral fellowship at the Argosy University training clinic. I am a member of the American Psychological Association and the Learning Disability Association of Washington.
