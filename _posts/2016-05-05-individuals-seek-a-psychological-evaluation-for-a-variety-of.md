Individuals seek a psychological evaluation for a variety of reasons. For example, many primary care physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and therapists refer their patients for evaluations in order to inform their treatment plans. In addition, individuals or parents of adolescents seek evaluations to determine the presence of learning disabilities, ADHD, or other mental health disorders that are impacting their functioning in school, work, or their social lives. 

Regardless of the questions that bring you in for an assessment, my role is to provide information and/or recommendations that will assist you and/or the individual who has referred you. As an evaluator, I must remain neutral and carefully consider all information. I cannot promise to provide a certain diagnosis or a certain outcome, but will commit to providing an assessment that is as objective as possible.
