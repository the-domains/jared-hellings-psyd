I am in-network with Premera, Regence, First Choice, and Medicare. I will bill your insurance directly, but cannot guarantee payment from your insurance provider. It is your responsibility to find out from your insurance company the extent to which your mental health benefit may be limited. In the event that your insurance denies payment you will be responsible for the balance on your account. 

For the insurance companies that I am not in-network with, they may provide "out-of-network" benefits that may also cover my services. I will provide you with a specific type of receipt that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. Here are a few questions I recommend asking your insurance company: 

* Do I have mental health benefits? 
* What is my deductible and has it been met? 
* Are there session limits per calendar year?
* What portion of the fee will I be responsible for? 
* Is approval required from my primary care physician? 

Specific Questions for Out-of-Network insurance companies: 

* Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits? 
* What is my deductible and has it been met? 
* Are there session limits per calendar year? 
* What portion of the fee will I be responsible for? 
* Is approval required from my primary care physician? 

Specific Questions for Psychological Testing: 

* Is psychological testing covered? 
* Are there limits for the hours/units of testing? 
* Is psychological testing subject to a deductible? 
* What portion of the fee will I be responsible for? 
* Are there certain diagnoses that are not covered?
