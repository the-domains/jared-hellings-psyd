            <description><![CDATA[<p>1. Diagnostic Interview: This is a 55 minute appointment where we can identify the presenting concerns and some important history. For young children, I prefer to gather the bulk of the history without them present so that parents can talk freely about their concerns without upsetting the kids. I will also spend some one-on-one time with kids to help establish some rapport and get to know them. For teenagers, I will gather the history from them and their parents. For adults, if you prefer to have a spouse, relative, or close friend to help provide details of current or past functioning, they are welcome to participate in the diagnostic interview. It is also helpful to bring any previous records that might be relevant. </p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Therapy]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Psychotherapy (also called therapy or counseling) is a process of mutual collaboration between therapist and client to identify the underlying causes of distress and find more adaptive and satisfying alternatives. Although there are many approaches to psychotherapy, research continues to demonstrate that the most crucial aspect is a strong professional relationship between client and therapist that is based on understanding, empathy, and openness. Therefore, I focus on creating a non-judgmental atmosphere that allows for an exploration of an individual’s thoughts, feelings, relationships, and life patterns. Above all, it is important that you feel understood. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Individuals seek a psychological evaluation for a variety of reasons. For example, many primary care physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and therapists refer their patients for evaluations in order to inform their treatment plans. In addition, individuals or parents of adolescents seek evaluations to determine the presence of learning disabilities, ADHD, or other mental health disorders that are impacting their functioning in school, work, or their social lives. </p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a licensed clinical psychologist in Washington State (#60068969). After completing a bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Central Washington University, I started working with teenagers in group homes and the foster care system. I worked with so many special kids and families; they inspired me to pursue further training so I completed a doctorate in clinical psychology (PsyD) at Argosy University in 2008. </p>]]></description>
