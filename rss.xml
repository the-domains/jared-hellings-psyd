            <title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a licensed clinical psychologist in Washington State (#60068969). After completing a bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Central Washington University, I started working with teenagers in group homes and the foster care system. I worked with so many special kids and families; they inspired me to pursue further training so I completed a doctorate in clinical psychology (PsyD) at Argosy University in 2008. </p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Psychotherapy]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Psychotherapy (also called therapy or counseling) is a process of mutual collaboration between therapist and client to identify the underlying causes of distress and find more adaptive and satisfying alternatives. Although there are many approaches to psychotherapy, research continues to demonstrate that the most crucial aspect is a strong professional relationship between client and therapist that is based on understanding, empathy, and openness. Therefore, I focus on creating a non-judgmental atmosphere that allows for an exploration of an individual’s thoughts, feelings, relationships, and life patterns. Above all, it is important that you feel understood. </p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Assessment]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Individuals seek a psychological evaluation for a variety of reasons. For example, many primary care physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and therapists refer their patients for evaluations in order to inform their treatment plans. In addition, individuals or parents of adolescents seek evaluations to determine the presence of learning disabilities, ADHD, or other mental health disorders that are impacting their functioning in school, work, or their social lives. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am in-network with Premera, Regence, First Choice, and Medicare. I will bill your insurance directly, but cannot guarantee payment from your insurance provider. It is your responsibility to find out from your insurance company the extent to which your mental health benefit may be limited. In the event that your insurance denies payment you will be responsible for the balance on your account. </p>]]></description>
